# Shut-Down


In this Go project, a master node communicates with multiple slave nodes in a distributed system. The master node sends shutdown instructions to all slave nodes, directing them to cease their operations gracefully. The communication protocol between the master and slaves ensures that the shutdown process is synchronized and orderly, allowing the system to shut down efficiently without data loss or disruption
